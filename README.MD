# CS649 Assignment 4

In this assignment, you will build on your previous assignment by taking advantage of MongoDB and other tools. Your job will be to eliminate the array-based storage of your application and instead, create a new MongoDB database and collection. Then, you will reconfigure your inventory management application to begin creating data within and retrieving data from your MongoDB database.

### General Points to Consider

1)	As was outlined in the book, restructure your application to take advantage of an api folder and a separate ui folder. Make sure to configure the appropriate package.json files and install the corresponding dependencies within each directory. The server should run at localhost:3000 while the ui should be running at localhost:8000.
2)	Reconfigure your project to use global variables via .env. URLs and port numbers should all be reconfigured now to use global variables DB_URL and API_SERVER_PORT respectively. Make sure that you have a .env file to read these values from in both api and ui folders. Again, you will need to install the appropriate dependencies and configure each file in your application accordingly.
3)	Reconfigure your application to store data within MongoDB. When the user adds a new product, the category, product name, price, and image path (string) should be created within MongoDB. Remember, MongoDB will automatically create a unique identifier for you. Even so, you still need to store the ID that is part of your schema and figure out a way to increment that within the collection.
4)	Reconfigure your application to retrieve data from MongoDB. Once youâ€™re confident that your connections to your MongoDB instance are successful, remove the array code from your application entirely.
5)	Install and configure ESLint. Lint your code and fix all errors before submitting your assignment.

Note: Although we covered WebPack in this module, you will not be required to configure your project to use it in this assignment.
